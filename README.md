# Descriptive Statistics with Python Project


Descriptive statistics gives us the basic summary measures about the dataset.  The summary measures are `measures of central tendency` (mean, median and mode) and `measures of dispersion and variability` (variance, standard deviation, minimum/maximum values, IQR (Interquartile Range), skewness and kurtosis). In this project, I have described these summary measures. I have used the `fortune 500` dataset from the data world website for this project.

## 1. Introduction to Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics are numbers that are used to describe and summarize the data. They are used to describe the basic features of the data under consideration. They provide simple summary measures which give an overview of the dataset. Summary measures that are commonly used to describe a data set are measures of central tendency and measures of variability or dispersion. 

Measures of central tendency include the `mean`, `median` and `mode`. These measures summarize a given data set by providing a single data point. These measures describe the center position of a distribution for a data set. We analyze the frequency of each data point in the distribution and describes it using the mean, median or mode. They provide the average of a data set. They can be either a representation of entire population or a sample of the population.

Measures of variability or dispersion include the `variance` or `standard deviation`, `coefficient of variation`,  `minimum` and `maximum` values, `IQR (Interquartile Range)`,  `skewness` and `kurtosis`. These measures help us to analyze how spread-out the distribution is for a dataset. So, they provide the shape of the data set.

## 2. Sample vs Population

The measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion are used to describe the data set under consideration. The data set may be the whole population or a sample of the population. I will start the discussion with population.


### Population

-	A population is a collection of all of the items in the dataset.
-	They are usually denoted with an upper case letter N.
-	The numbers we obtain by using a population are called **parameters**.
-	Populations are hard to define and hard to observe in real life. 


### Sample

-	A sample is a subset of the population.
-	They are usually denoted with a lower case letter n.
-	The numbers we obtain by using a sample are called **statistics**.
-	A sample is much easier to gather. They are less time-consuming and cheaper. Time and resources are the main reasons we prefer   
  analysing samples rather populations.
-	They have two key characteristics - **randomness** and **representativeness**.
-	**Randomness** means a random sample is collected when each member of the sample is chosen from the population strictly by chance.
-	**Representativeness** means a representative sample is a subset of the population that accurately reflects the members of the entire 
  population.
