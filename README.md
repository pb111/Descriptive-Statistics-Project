# Descriptive Statistics with Python Project


Descriptive statistics gives us the basic summary measures about the dataset.  The summary measures are `measures of central tendency` (mean, median and mode) and `measures of dispersion and variability` (variance, standard deviation, minimum/maximum values, IQR (Interquartile Range), skewness and kurtosis). In this project, I have described these summary measures. I have used the `fortune 500` dataset from the data world website for this project.
